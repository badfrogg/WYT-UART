## Pioneer WYT UART hacking

This is probably useless to anyone who might stumble upon it.
Just my raw notes that even I can hardly understand since I took some time off working on it.

I still want to figure this out though and I may start again soon.

This is to break the chains of having to have a third party cloud app to control my air conditioner and be able to command it trough the serial UART.

I intended to have full control and feedbackâ€¦ one day.

 - `bytes-n-bits` I did some reverse engineering of Tx and Rx strings that were captured while commanding the air conditioner with the app. Pretty sure this is just feedback stuff, i.e. reverse engineering just the Rx.
