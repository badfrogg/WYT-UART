## Pioneer WYT UART hacking

This is probably useless to anyone who might stumble upon it.
Just my raw notes that I can hardly understand since I took some time off working on it.

I still want to figure this out though and I may start again soon.

This is to break the chains of having to have a third party cloud app to control my air conditioner and be able to command it trough the serial UART.

I intended to have full control and feedbackâ€¦ one day.
